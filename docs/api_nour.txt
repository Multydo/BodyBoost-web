    info:
        this will get the bodypart with the requested start id

        }

        if it is the first time of runing the request the lastId slot should equal to (-1) so 
        the server will now that it is the first run of the request and will run a code to get the
        first row of the body part we want . if the response hade (state = true ) this meen we can 
        request more of the same type of body part by passing in the lastId the "last id we got in 
        the response array"
